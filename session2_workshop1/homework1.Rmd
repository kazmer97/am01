# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```

What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about?

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
skimr::skim(drinks)

alcohol_data <- drinks

```

The variable types are character and numeric. There are no missing values.

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
top25_beer <- drinks %>%
  slice_max(., order_by = beer_servings, n = 25)
  

ggplot(top25_beer,aes(y = reorder(country, beer_servings), x = beer_servings))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Beer Servings",
       y = "Country",
       title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
  

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

top25_wine<- drinks %>%
  slice_max(.,order_by = wine_servings,n=25)

ggplot(top25_wine, aes(y = reorder(country, wine_servings), x = wine_servings ))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Wine Servings",
       y = "Country",
       title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

top25_spirit<- drinks %>%
  slice_max(.,order_by = spirit_servings,n=25)

ggplot(top25_spirit, aes(y = reorder(country, spirit_servings), x = spirit_servings ))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Spirit Servings",
       y = "Country",
       title = "Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

The countries at the top of the list have high production of the given alcoholic beverage. Historic national connection to the given drink and national pride in its production seems to be an influencing factor in the choice of alcohol consumption. For example in Namibia the brewing industry is [regarded as a source of national pride](https://theconversation.com/beer-politics-and-identity-the-chequered-history-behind-namibian-brewing-success-155719).

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

-   Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
-   Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
-   Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many \$ did a movie make at the box office for each \$ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order
-   Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.
-   Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.
```{r}
skimr::skim(movies)
unique(movies)
```
There are no missing values. There are no duplicat entries however the same titles appear multiple types which is indicative of movie remakes.
```{r}

# number of movies by genre in descending order
movies_by_genre <- movies %>%
  select(genre)%>%
  count(genre, sort=TRUE, name = "NumOfMovies")
  
# return on budget
average_gross <- movies%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise(avg_budget = mean(budget),
            avg_gross = mean(gross))%>%
  mutate(returnBudget = (avg_gross/avg_budget)-1)%>%
  arrange(desc(returnBudget))

# top15 director by gross
top15_gDirectors <- movies%>%
  group_by(director)%>%
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross),
         avg_gross = mean(gross),
         std_gross = sd(gross),
         median_gross = median(gross))%>%
  slice_max(.,order_by = total_gross, n=15)
  
#rating by Genre
ratingByGenre <- movies%>%
  group_by(genre)%>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            max_rating = max(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating),
            median_rating = median(rating))


ggplot(movies, aes(y = rating, x = genre))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x = "Genre",
       y = "Rating",
       title = "Ratings by Genre")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.8))+
  NULL
  


```

## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(x = "Number of Facebook Likes of the Cast Members",
       y = "Gross Box Office Revenue",
       title = "Relationship between Cast Facebook Likes and Gross Box Office Revenue")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

  sprintf("The correlation between cast facebook likes and gross is: %f",cor(movies$cast_facebook_likes, movies$gross))

```
The relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes` is of positive has a 0.213 correlation which is not strong, meaning it is not the best predictor.


-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y = gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  labs(x = "Budget of the Movie",
       y = "Box Office Gross Revenue",
       title = "Relationship between Budget and Box Office Revenue")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

sprintf("Correlation between budget and gross: %f", s<-cor(movies$budget, movies$gross))
```
The correlation between a movies budget and gross revenue at the box office has a stronger correlation than the facebook likes of the cast and the revenue, it is a better predictor of gross, but the correaltion is still below 0.7.


-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating}

ggplot(movies,aes(x = rating, y = gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  scale_y_log10()+
  facet_wrap(~genre)+
  labs(x = "Ratings",
       y = "Gross Box Office Revenue",
       title = "Relationship between Ratings and Box Office Revenue by Genre")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```
IMDB ratings are a weak predictor of a movies success at the box office as it can be seen for most cases the best fit line is almost horizontal. 
The dataset is unbalanced in the sense that Action movies are over represented while Thriller, Musical, Romance, Western and Family barely have datapoints. Using it to learn about tendencies in genre would result in a incorrect statistical conclusions.

# Returns of financial stocks

> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mam2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/).

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
glimpse(nyse)
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

companiesPerSector <- nyse%>%
  group_by(sector)%>%
  count(sort = TRUE, name = "numOfComp")
  

ggplot(companiesPerSector, aes(x = numOfComp, y = reorder(sector,numOfComp)))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Number of Companies",
       y = "Sector",
       title = "Number of Companies in each Sector within the Dataset")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
  

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument inthe chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("AAPL","JPM","DIS","DPZ","ANF","TSLA","XOM","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

monthlyReturnSummary <- myStocks_returns_monthly%>%
  summarise(monthly_max = max(monthly_returns),
            monthly_min = min(monthly_returns),
            monthly_mean = mean(monthly_returns),
            monthly_median = median(monthly_returns),
            monthly_sd = sd(monthly_returns))

```

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(monthly_returns))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(~symbol)+
  labs(x = "Distribution of Monthly Return",
       y = "Probability % ",
       title  = "Probability Distribution of Monthly Returns")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

Tesla is the riskiest stock as it has the highest spread, which means its monthly standard deviations are the highest. 
The least risky is SPY as it has the narrowest spread.



Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(monthlyReturnSummary, aes(x = monthly_sd, y = monthly_mean))+
  geom_point(size = 4)+
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = symbol), size = 4)+
  labs(x = "Standard Deviation of Monthly Returns",
       y = "Average Monthly Returns",
       title = "Risk vs Potential Return")+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL
  

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

ANF is much riskier than most, while delivering the second lowest returns. 


# On your own: IBM HR Analytics

For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

First let us load the data

```{r}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description

```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

```{r}
hr_numeric <- hr_dataset%>%
  clean_names()%>%
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)
```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1.  How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)
2.  How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?
3.  How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total
4.  Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?
5.  Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first
6.  Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.
7.  Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`
8.  Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r}
# job satisfaction by department
hr_numeric%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=job_role, y = job_satisfaction))+
  geom_boxplot()
  
```

```{r}
attrition_number <- count(hr_cleaned["attrition"]=="Yes")

attrition_frequency <- attrition_number/nrow(hr_cleaned)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(hr_cleaned)

```

```{r}
prop.table(table(hr_cleaned["job_satisfaction"]))

prop.table(table(hr_cleaned["work_life_balance"]))


```

```{r}

ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x = education, y = monthly_income))+
  geom_boxplot()

cor(hr_dataset["Education"],hr_dataset["MonthlyIncome"])
```

```{r}
gender_income <- hr_dataset %>% 
  mutate(binary_gender = case_when(Gender=="Male" ~0 ,
                                   Gender == "Female" ~ 1))%>%
  select(MonthlyIncome,binary_gender)

cor(gender_income["binary_gender"],hr_dataset["MonthlyIncome"])

ggplot(hr_dataset,aes(x = Gender, MonthlyIncome))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(job_role,-monthly_income),y=monthly_income))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Boxplot of Monthly Income Against Job Role", x="Job Role", y="Monthly Income")
```

```{r}
mean_education <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(monthly_income))%>%
  print(mean_education)

ggplot(mean_education,aes(x=education,y=mean))+
  geom_col()

median_education <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median=median(monthly_income))%>%
  print(median_education)

ggplot(median_education,aes(x=education,y=median))+
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(monthly_income))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~education)+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=monthly_income,x=age))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~job_role)

```

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```

You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgouns and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1.  To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh)
2.  You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
3.  Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

```

```{r}
vaccinations%>%filter(fips=="51670")
```

```{r}

print(vaccinations%>%filter(fips=="05091"))

vax_complete_pop_pct <- vaccinations%>%
  filter(completeness_pct>90.0)%>%

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor). The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian.

The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.

```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )



```

```{r}
library(plotly)

german_graph <- ggplot(german_election_polls, aes(x=end_date)) +
       geom_point(aes(y = union), color = "black", size=0.5, alpha=0.3) + 
       geom_smooth(aes(y=union), color="black", size=0.7, span=0.05, se=FALSE)+

       geom_smooth(aes(y=spd), color="darkred", size=0.7, span=0.05, se=FALSE)+
       geom_point(aes(y = grune), color="darkgreen", size=0.5, alpha=0.3) +
       geom_smooth(aes(y=grune), color="darkgreen", size=0.7, span=0.105, se=FALSE)+

            subtitle = "who will be the next Chancellor?",
            x = "Date (last updated 3 Sep 2021)",
            y = "Percent of Voter Population")

ggplotly(german_graph + ylim(5, 45))

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
